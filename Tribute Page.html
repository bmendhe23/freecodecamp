  		<h2><strong>About</strong></h2>
    	
    	<p>Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw was arguably the greatest soldier the Indian Army has ever produced.</p>
		
		<p>As the Chief of the Army Staff, Sam’s service to the nation is immense as he united the army, navy and air force into a team, helping India win against Pakistan in 1965 and even more significantly the 1971 Indo-Pakistan war that led to the liberation of Bangladesh.</p>

		<h2><strong>Childhood & Early Life</strong></h2>
		<ul>
			<li><p>Sam was born to Parsi parents in Amritsar. His father, Hormusji Manekshaw was a doctor. His mother’s name was Heerabai and he had three brothers and two sisters.</p></li>
			<li><p>Sam’s father had been a Captain in the Royal British Army and had come to Amritsar from Bombay where he had started a medical practice and pharmacy.</p></li>
			<li><p>He was educated at the Sherwood College in Nainital. He was a brilliant student and achieved a distinction in the School Certificate examination of the Cambridge Board.</p></li>
			<li><p>Setting his eyes on becoming a doctor, he asked his father to send him to England to study medicine. His father felt Sam was too young to be on his own and refused to send him until he was older.</p></li>
			<li><p>The teenager was upset that his father refused and in rebellion he decided to appear for the entrance examination for enrollment into the Indian Military Academy (IMA).</p></li>
		</ul>

		<li><p>It was a very difficult time for the Indian Army as they faced the invading Japanese Army while fighting around Pagoda Hill. In spite of all the challenges they captured the hill though Manekshaw was gravely wounded. Ever the gritty man, he soon recovered and resumed his duties.</p></li>
		<li><p>He attended the 8th Staff Course at Staff College, Quetta from August to December 1943 after which he was posted as the Brigade Major of the Razmak brigade. He served there till October 1944.</p></li>
